## TO COMPILE SCSS TO CSS
1. Make changes to main.scss:
    This file: main.scss imports bootstrap/bootstrap.scss and css/_custom.scss
    This file: assets/css/main.scss compiles and outputs to assets/css/main.css
    This file: _layouts/default.html links to main.css like this:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ '/assets/css/main.css' | relative_url }}">

2. Once you run 'bundle exec jekyll serve --trace' then Jekyll will compile the scss and create this file: _site/assets/css/main.css file
3. Open the server page http://127.0.0.1:4000/  and verify it has compiled correctly.

## TO ADD CUSTOM CSS
Add custom styles to assets/css/_custom.scss
It will then be imported into assets/css/main.scss and compiled to assets/css/main.css


## TO IMPORT ONLY SPECIFIC BOOTSTRAP FILES
1. Open main.scss and disable or comment-out this line:  @import 'bootstrap/bootstrap  so it should look like this :
// @import 'bootstrap/bootstrap';
2. Next Open bootstrap/bootstrap.scss and select all the imports, then copy them to your clipboard.
3. Next open main.scss and paste all the imports below this one:
        // @import 'bootstrap/bootstrap';
4. Make sure that the custom import is at the bottom:
        @import 'custom';
5. Comment out the imports that you will not be using and save the file.
6. Test to be sure it is working.


## LOCATION OF STUFF
The pages directory holds all the site's pages.
Each page has front-matter with details about the layout and title of the page.
The _layouts/page.html extends the _layouts/default.html


## TO UPDATE BOOTSTRAP VERSION
1. Go to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/download/  and download the latest source files for bootstrap.
2. Extract the file and copy the scss folder to this project folder, in the assets/css directory.
3. Rename the existing bootstrap folder to: bootstrap_old.
4. Rename the scss folder to bootstrap.
5. Import the specific files into your main.scss file or import the whole bootstrap file like this:
         @import 'bootstrap/bootstrap';
6. Add your custom imports below it like this and save the file:
            @import 'custom';

7. Be sure to test everything is working.
8. When you are sure everything is working, then delete the bootstrap_old folder.
9. Dont forget that you will need to prefix (with bootstrap)  the imported bootstrap files like this:
            @import "bootstrap/functions";
            @import "bootstrap/variables";

Once you run 'bundle exec jekyll serve --trace' then Jekyll will compile the scss and create this file: _site/assets/css/main.css file
